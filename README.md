# github-pull
pull stuff from github to winsvideo.
# How it works
there will be a private page on winsvideo for devs <br> once a dev does an update on github they need to go winsvideo.net/pull.php (This will be a private page with http basic auth, win please contact me on discord or twitter and ill help you out). The developer then clicks the "Pull changes from github" button and then the changes from github will be applied to winsvideo.
